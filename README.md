#**Weather Forecast SPA**

This repository contains files for a **Weather Forecast Single-Page Application (SPA)** created with **AngularJS**.

The application allows the user to retrieve the daily forecast of high and low temperatures for any city that has forecast data available. The user may pull back up to 16 days worth of forecast data.

This application uses the daily forecast API provided by **[openweathermap.org](http://openweathermap.org)**.
